## Introduction/Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a compact incubator capable of automatically nurturing a plant. Elements such as nutrients, temperature, humidity, light and pH will all be part of the controlled environment. These elements will be monitored and controlled using a Raspberry pi and an LCD screen. The purpose of this program is to provide a GUI for the LCD and to harmonize all the different variables in order to create an appropriate climate for the plant.

## Features
* Customizable day/night light cycles
* Four nutrient chambers
* Mixing chambers to create recipes with the right ratios
* Water level detection
* pH readings
* Temperature and humidity control
